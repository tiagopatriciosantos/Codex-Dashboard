# Codex Usage Dashboard

A local dashboard for tracking Codex quota windows, token history, API-equivalent token cost, and estimated model efficiency.

The dashboard runs entirely on your computer. It starts `codex app-server`, reads account-level quota information, scans local Codex session logs, and stores its own historical snapshots in SQLite.

## What it shows

- Current 5-hour usage, reset time, recent burn rate, and projected usage at reset.
- Current 7-day usage, reset time, recent burn rate, and projected usage at reset.
- Over-limit reporting that preserves percentages above 100% instead of clipping them.
- Reset-aware projections that restart the trend after an unexpected downward quota change.
- Graceful handling when Codex does not report a 5-hour window. The card shows **Not reported** while older history remains stored.
- Graphs for the active 5-hour and 7-day quota windows.
- Daily token activity for the last seven days.
- Per-thread model, total tokens, cached/uncached input, output, reasoning output, and estimated API-equivalent cost.
- Estimated 5-hour and 7-day quota consumed by each thread, based on timestamp-bracketed task runs.
- User-facing Codex chat names read directly from the local desktop state, with App Server metadata and the first cleaned prompt used only as fallbacks.
- Search, over-limit filtering, sorting, persistent section navigation, and a responsive mobile worklist.
- Expandable thread details with prompt-level token use, timing, first-token latency, cache use, model, and estimated cost.
- Separate model graphs for total tokens and API-equivalent cost.
- Total indexed tokens and total API-equivalent cost.
- Estimated minutes per 1% of quota for each model.
- Accuracy notes that distinguish direct Codex data from calculated estimates.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.5 or newer.
- The current Codex CLI installed and available as `codex` in your terminal.
- A working Codex login, normally through ChatGPT-managed authentication.

Check the prerequisites:

```powershell
node --version
codex --version
```

If Codex is installed but not signed in, run:

```powershell
codex login
```

## Run in development mode

Open PowerShell in this folder:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

The frontend runs on port 5173 and proxies `/api` requests to the local backend on port 8787.

## Run the production build

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8787
```

## Test the interface without Codex data

Edit `.env` and set:

```dotenv
DEMO_MODE=true
```

Restart the app. Demo mode uses generated data and does not start Codex App Server or read local session logs.

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Supported values:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| `CODEX_BIN` | `codex` | Codex executable or full path to it. |
| `CODEX_HOME` | `~/.codex` | Folder containing Codex sessions and archived sessions. |
| `RATE_LIMIT_POLL_MS` | `60000` | Account quota polling interval. |
| `ACCOUNT_USAGE_POLL_MS` | `900000` | Account daily-token summary polling interval. |
| `THREAD_METADATA_POLL_MS` | `900000` | App Server thread-name and preview refresh interval. |
| `SESSION_SCAN_MS` | `120000` | Local session-log scan interval. |

On Windows, `CODEX_HOME` can be written as:

```dotenv
CODEX_HOME=C:\Users\YourName\.codex
```

The generated database is stored at:

```text
data/codex-usage.sqlite
```

Delete that file only when you intentionally want to erase the dashboard's collected history.

## How the data works

### Quota windows

The backend calls these documented Codex App Server methods:

- `account/read`
- `account/rateLimits/read`
- `account/usage/read`

It also listens for `account/rateLimits/updated` and immediately refreshes the full snapshot.

The app identifies windows by `windowDurationMins`, not by their position in the response:

- approximately `300` minutes → 5-hour window
- approximately `10080` minutes → 7-day window

This avoids assuming that `primary` always means one specific window. When the 5-hour window is missing, the application does not invent a value.

### Projections

For each active quota window, the backend fits a linear trend to recent local snapshots. It calculates:

- percent used per hour
- projected percentage at reset
- estimated time the quota would reach 100%
- pace compared with the rate required to last until reset
- confidence based on the number and time span of collected samples

The projection is an estimate. The reported `usedPercent` and `resetsAt` values remain the authoritative values.
If reported usage drops unexpectedly inside the same nominal window, the dashboard treats that point as a reset boundary and fits only the continuous samples after it. Raw values above 100% remain intact in storage, charts, and projections.

### Thread tokens and models

The session scanner reads JSONL files under:

```text
~/.codex/sessions
~/.codex/archived_sessions
```

It looks for incremental token-usage events, model metadata, timestamps, working directory, thread ID, user prompts, task start/completion events, and embedded rate-limit snapshots. This parser is intentionally isolated in `server/sessionLogs.ts` because local log formats can change.

The backend also calls App Server `thread/list` for persisted thread metadata. When Codex reports a user-facing thread name, the dashboard uses it. If no name is available, it uses the App Server preview and then the first cleaned prompt as fallbacks.

Each normal thread is grouped with its reviewer/guardian session parts. The main Sol/Terra model remains the displayed primary model, while auto-review tokens are shown as review overhead.

The parser can recover prior usage only when the corresponding local session files still exist and contain usable records. It does not invent missing tokens. A thread whose model cannot be matched to `config/pricing.json` remains visible, but its price is excluded from the total.

### Per-thread usage and prompt metrics

Codex does not directly provide an exact “this thread used X% of the quota” value. The dashboard estimates thread-level 5-hour and 7-day usage from completed task timestamps. For each run, it takes the quota sample at or before the start and the sample at or after completion, then subtracts the two percentages. Separate runs of a long-lived thread are calculated independently, so quota changes during idle gaps are not attributed to that thread. When coarse polling brackets multiple sequential tasks, the observed change is divided by active run time to avoid double-counting. A downward quota change splits attribution into separate reset segments; estimates remain blank unless every completed run is fully bracketed by reliable samples.

Expanded thread rows show prompt segments recovered from local logs. Timing is labeled by quality:

- **Exact** when Codex reports a task duration or first-token latency.
- **Derived** when duration is calculated from logged prompt, task, and completion timestamps.
- **Unavailable** when the required events were not persisted.

Steering messages sent while a task is already running are treated as separate prompts when the rollout log preserves them. Token events are assigned to the active prompt segment on a best-effort basis.

### Model token and cost graphs

The model token graph sums input and output token events by the model recorded for each request. The cost graph sums the API-equivalent estimate for those same events. Auto-review remains a separate model category in these graphs so its overhead is visible, even though it is grouped under the parent thread in the thread table.

### API-equivalent cost

The cost is an estimate of what the observed text tokens would cost at the public API rate. It is **not** an amount charged to the ChatGPT subscription.

The calculator separates:

- uncached input tokens
- cached input tokens
- output tokens

For supported long-context models, a request whose input exceeds the configured threshold uses the configured long-context multiplier. Prices, aliases, and historical rate changes are stored in `config/pricing.json` so they can be updated without changing the application code. Historical session costs are calculated using the rate effective when each token event was recorded.

`reasoningOutputTokens` is displayed separately when available, but is not added again to cost if it is already included in output-token accounting.

### Minutes per 1% by model

Codex does not directly attribute account quota percentage to individual models. The dashboard estimates this metric from the 30 most recently completed chats by correlating:

1. each completed task's start and completion timestamps,
2. the quota values immediately bracketing that task, and
3. the task's primary model and actual active duration.

The chart reports actual task minutes per estimated 1% of quota; a higher value means the model sustained more active work per percentage point. When coarse polling brackets multiple sequential tasks, the quota change is divided by their active durations so it is not counted twice. Treat this graph as comparative rather than exact.

## Accuracy limits

- Historical quota points can be recovered from older rollout logs when those logs contain rate-limit snapshots. Gaps that were never logged cannot be reconstructed.
- `account/usage/read` may provide older daily token buckets, depending on the account and authentication mode.
- A separate dashboard does not automatically receive every live per-thread event from another Codex client, so local session logs are used for thread and prompt accounting.
- Thread-level quota percentages are timestamp-based estimates, not values directly reported by Codex.
- User-facing thread names depend on App Server metadata. A prompt-derived fallback is shown when no persisted name is returned.
- Token totals do not convert directly into ChatGPT quota percentage. Model, caching, reasoning, tools, images, and Codex service accounting can affect quota use.
- API-equivalent prices can become outdated. Review `config/pricing.json` after model or pricing changes.

## Updating Codex safely

The dashboard does not modify the official Codex interface, so normal UI updates do not affect it. App Server or local session-log changes can require adjustments.

To limit update breakage:

1. Keep all App Server payload handling in `server/codex/`.
2. Keep all local-log assumptions in `server/sessionLogs.ts`.
3. Ignore unknown fields and tolerate missing optional fields.
4. Test an updated Codex version with `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and a manual refresh.
5. When needed, generate schemas from the installed Codex version with Codex App Server's schema-generation command and compare them with the adapter types.

The dashboard's React components, database, projections, and charts should normally remain unchanged when the Codex protocol evolves.

## Useful commands

```powershell
npm run dev        # Backend and frontend with live reload
npm run typecheck  # TypeScript checks for both sides
npm run build      # Compile backend and production frontend
npm start          # Run the compiled production application
```

## Troubleshooting

### `codex` is not recognized

Set an absolute executable path in `.env`:

```dotenv
CODEX_BIN=C:\path\to\codex.exe
```

### Dashboard says Codex is disconnected

Run `codex` directly first and confirm it is signed in. Set `DEBUG_CODEX_DASHBOARD=true`, restart the dashboard, and inspect the terminal output.

### No local threads appear

Confirm `CODEX_HOME` points to the folder containing `sessions` or `archived_sessions`. Create or finish a Codex thread, wait for the next scan, and press the refresh button.

### A model has no estimated price

Add an entry or alias to `config/pricing.json`, then restart the backend. Keep the price date current.

### SQLite warning on Node 22

Node 22 may print an experimental warning for its built-in SQLite module. The dashboard still works. Newer Node releases may no longer print that warning.
